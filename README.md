## Description
The purpose of this model is to provide a comprehensive research and to develop a model to predict the loan defaults. This kind of models becomes inevitable as the issue of bad loans are very much critical in the financial sector especially in micro financing banks of various underdeveloped and developed countries. To cope up with this problem a comprehensive literature review was done to study the significant factors that leads to this issue.
